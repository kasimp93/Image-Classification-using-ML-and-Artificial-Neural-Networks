Here, we have a large amount of scripts that run the MATLAB Toolbox implementation of ANN's  for both
the 2 class and 15 class datasets.  

GIST and CENTRIST code is needed to run these files. 

Below is a list of .m files and what they do:
1) TEST_GIST_2class --> use ANN on GIST features for 2 class dataset
2) TEST_GIST_15class --> use ANN on GIST features for 15 class dataset
3) TEST_CENTRIST_2class --> use ANN on CENTRIST features for 2 class dataset
4) TEST_CENTRIST_15class --> use ANN on CENTRIST features for 15 class dataset
5) TEST_COMBINED_2class --> use ANN on Combined features for 2 class dataset
6) TEST_COMBINED_15class --> use ANN on Combined features for 15 class dataset
7) comp_combined_2class --> obtain a combined feature vector for a test image for the 2 class dataset
8) comp_combined_15class --> obtain a combined feature vector for a test image for the 15 class dataset
