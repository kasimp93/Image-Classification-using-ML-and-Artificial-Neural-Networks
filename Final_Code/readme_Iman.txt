The main code to open is ANN_main.m, this code calls two functions ANN_train.m and ANN_test.m
I describe what is needed to be done in the beginning of ANN_main.m 
The last file Presentation_examples.m is just to calculate some results the we showed for the presentations,
It needed the optimized weights i saved which were a lot so i added 2 of them just for clarity, if you run that code
the classified results for 15 scene Gist and Comb for the included four images will come up as numbers from 1-15 which are from the
