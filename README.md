# Image Classification using ML and Artificial Neural Networks

Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers are a computational method designed with the ultimate goal of mimicking our brain circuitry. ANNs are an attempt to model this sophisticated process and with the advancement of computer. To understand this model, its benefits and comparing its performance to classical methods such as K-NN, etc. in the context of image classification, specifically, scene classification in RGB images using holistic image features.
